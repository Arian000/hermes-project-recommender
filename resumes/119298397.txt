Selected Projects
2022 Automatic acute lymphoblastic leukemia classification model using Color Histogram Features
I developed a CNN model on color histogram features to achieve 100 Percent
Accuracy on ALL-IDB 2 data-set.
Supervisor: Dr. Hadieh Sajedi
2022 Automated Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning for
Brain Cancer
Used 1D CNN on Overlap Volume Histogram (OVH) features to predict a patientspecify set of IMRT objectives. This set is then used by famous algorithms to
plan a treatment without professional intervention.
Supervisor: Dr. Iraj Abedi
2021 Activity Recognition based on Wearable Physiological Measurements
Using Tree-Based Feature Selection and Classic Machine Learning Algorithms,
developed an State of the Art Ensemble Classification model.
Supervisor: Dr. Hadieh Sajedi
2020 Simulating a model of two excitatory and one inhibitory neuron populations
Using LIF base neurons, showed how the model responds and adapts to different
input and how different connections between neurons affect the model.
Supervisor: Dr. Saeed Reza Kheradpisheh
2019 Machine learning approach for screening of autism based on task-free fMRI
Used graph theory to extract features. We used a data-set of Utah School of
Medicine from ABIDE and achieved 70% accuracy.
Supervisor: Dr. Jamal Amani Rad
2018 Haplotype phasing with maximum parsimony
Used graph theory to achieve exact answer in 1−(2l
ength) of cases in reasonable
time for real biological data.
Supervisor: Dr. Changiz Eslahchi
2018 TSP art
Used a heuristic algorithm to achieve 3/2-opt in O(n
2 ∗ log(n)) time.
Supervisor: Dr. Ali Katanforoush
