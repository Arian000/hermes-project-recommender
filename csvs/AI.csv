16,Backend of a multi-service app.,"The app will consist of 3 services, starting from left to right: https://i.ibb.co/FYvChvM/Screenshot-2023-07-11-at-12-38-55-PM.png You will be building the User Service. You can use any framework/language to build it, but the database will be in Supabase. The communication will be as a REST API. Zephya is our internal name for the final service. I will be building Zephya alongside you. The frontend is built already, but we will make modifications to integrate it with the user service. ## This is what the entire app’s main flow looks like: Frontend: User attempts to login in using one of 3 options: * Google * Device (WebAuth) * Email Link. We can use any drop-in solution (like Firebase, Supabase, auth0 etc.) for any of these, provided the user doesn’t see the service being used when logging in. User Service: We store the user’s login information in our database. Frontend: After logging in, the user makes a call to the backend with a query. User Service: The user service will * Check if the query is authenticated * Compute some details related to the query * Store that query in the backend * Forward that query to Zephya. Zephya: Will stream events for that query until it’s completely answered. Events can be of two types: 1. Status events, which will tell the user what the status of the query is right now. 2. Clarify events, which will ask the user service for some information. User Service: When a status event is received, forward it to the frontend. When a clarify event is received, check if the information is available. If so, send it to Zephaya. If not, ask the user to enter this information through the frontend. This information will also be saved for later. This solution to this event system is open to ideas, some possible solutions I thought of were: 1. a. Zephya would stream SSE Server-side events back for status b. When it needs to make a clarify event, it will terminate the connection after sending the request for it c. Remember the query to continue by a unique ID. d. The unique ID will be used to continue the query with a new request once we have the information needed. 2. User service would open up a socket connection to Zephaya. All events would be transmitted over it, including request events. The socket connection would hold while the user service gets the required information. Other solutions are welcome. When the query is finally answered, we’ll format the result in the user service and send it to the frontend as well. Important point: The frontend may close the connection to the user service (for example, close the tab), and the query should still be answered in the background. If a clarify event is made, the user should provide that information when he reconnects (opens a new tab for the app). ## Other flows There are a couple other things a user can do on the app which aren’t as complicated, but will require using Open LLM APIs. Zephaya will not be used for them. They’ll be purely between the user service and the frontend. # How can you apply? - By telling me what solution for the events would be best (one of the above, or any other), and why. - What framework/language you would use to build the user service, and why. - What do you find interesting about this? You can answer these questions by applying on Replit or messaging me on Discord @ `zlenner`. I can share more details privately as well. # Deadline July 17th 2pm GMT+3 Cannot afford a delay, clear out your excuses beforehand.
